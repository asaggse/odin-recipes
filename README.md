# Recipe Website Project

This project aims to provide an opportunity to practice and apply HTML skills by building a basic recipe website. The website will serve as a platform to showcase various recipes, allowing users to navigate through a main index page with links to different recipes.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to strengthen HTML knowledge and improve proficiency in structuring web pages. The focus is on creating a functional website rather than focusing on visual design elements. Although the website may not have an elaborate appearance initially, it will be revisited in the future to enhance its aesthetics using CSS.

## Project Setup

To set up the project's GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.com named "odin-recipes".
2. Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine, placing it inside the "repos" folder created during the Git Basics lesson: `git clone git@github.com:username/odin-recipes.git` (replace "username" with your GitHub username).
3. Navigate to the "odin-recipes" project directory on your local machine using the command line interface.
4. Create a README.md file in the project directory.
5. Write a brief introduction in the README.md file, describing the project and the skills that will be demonstrated upon completion.

## Committing Changes

Throughout the project, follow these tips for effective version control:

- Run all Git commands from within the project's folder.
- Commit early and often, with meaningful commit messages for each significant change.
- Create a timeline of progress to showcase the development process.
- Remember to push the changes to the remote repository using `git push origin main`.
- Verify the changes on the GitHub repository webpage after pushing.

## Conclusion

This project provides an opportunity to practice HTML skills and reinforce the understanding of web page structure. It sets the foundation for future improvements in visual design using CSS. By building this recipe website, you will enhance your HTML proficiency and gain valuable experience in web development.

Now, let's dive in and start building!
